## Overview

In this example will create a map that arranges the led in spiral ( circular ) . 

Setup your leds count in Config, LED Preferences as usual, for example 8x8 matrix and a strip of 30 pixels chained at the end of your matrix, total count should be 64 + 30 =94. 
 
Go to Config, 2D setup page and create an 8x8 matrix, and then go to the segments, the 8x8 segments should be created automatically. For the 1D strip, add a new segment with the start pixel beyond the matrix, and it will automatically change to a 1D segment, as in this example

Note: If the matrix is chained after the strip, then use reversing at the bus level, i.e. check Reversed (rotated 180Â°) in LED & Hardware setup
